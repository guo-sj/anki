In real life, most security <b>breaches</b> are due to passwords that are given away or easily guessed.	an action that breaks an agreement to behave in a particular way    破坏	LongTermLearning
Occasionally, system administrative <b>lapses</b> make it possible for a malicious user to gain super-user permission.	a small mistake, especially one that is caused by forgotting sth or by being careless    小错误	LongTermLearning
Anybody can read the password file (you just did), so if your password file itself were there, anyone would be able to use it to <b>masquerade as</b> you.	to pretend to be sth that you are not(乔装)	LongTermLearning
The next three characters <i>(r--)</i> encode group permissions, in this case that people in group <i>admin</i>, presumably the system administrators, can read the file but not write or execute it.	used to say that you think that sth is probably true    大概	LongTermLearning
A <b>plausible</b> alternative would be for group <i>admin</i> to also have write permission on <i>/tec/password</i>.	reasonable and likely to be true    有道理的，可信的	LongTermLearning
(加一张图片P54)But the <i>s</i> instead of an <i>x</i> in the execute field for the file owner states that, when the command is run, it is to be given the permissions <b>corresponding to</b> the file owner, in this case <i>root</i>.	to be similar to or the same as sth else    类似于，相当于	LongTermLearning

Except for the usual <b>disclaimer</b> about super-users, only the owner of a file may change the permissions on a file, regardless of the permissions themselves.	免责声明	LongTermLearning
The administrative information is stored in the inode (over the years, the <b>hyphen</b> fell out of "i-node"), along with essential system data such as how long it is, where on the disc the contents of the file are stored, and so on.	the mark(-)    连字符	LongTermLearning

Expressions that might lose information, like assigning a longer integer type to a shorter, or a floating-point type to an integer, may <b>draw</b> a warning, but they are not illegal.	to produce a reaction or response    引起	LongTermLearning
A char is just a small integer, so chars may be freely used in arithmetic expressions. One is <b>exemplified</b> by this naive implementation of the function <i>atoi</i>, which converts a string of digits into its numeric equivalent.	to give an example in order to make sth clear    举例说明	LongTermLearning
This latter <b>observation</b> is not true of the EBCIDC character set, however, so this code would convert more than just letters in EBCIDC.	结论	LongTermLearning
The Brooklyn Nets needed much more than points Tuesday night, so Durant gave them one of the most <b>spectacular</b> performances in postseason history.	very impressive    壮观的	LongTermLearning
“I know the <b>perception</b> of me is that I can score the basketball well, but any team that I’ve played on, I’ve been asked to do pretty much everything from rebounding to defending to initiating to scoring,” Durant said. “I might not do it all the time but I do a little bit of everything.”	the way you notice things, especially with the senses    感知	LongTermLearning
