The kernel is a program that <b>constitutes</b> the central core of a computer operating system.	to be considered to be sth  被看作是，被认为是

 The BIOS is an independent program stored in a chip on the motherboard (the main <b>circuit board</b> of a computer) that is used during the booting process for such tasks as initializing the hardware and loading the kernel into memory.	电路板
 Whereas the BIOS always remains in the computer and is <b>specific</b> to its particular hardware, the kernel can be easily replaced or upgraded by changing or upgrading the operating system or, in the case of Linux, by adding a newer kernel or modifying an existing kernel.	existing only in one place or limited to one thing 特定的

Hybrid kernels are similar to microkernels, except that they include additional code in kernel space so that such code can run more <b>swiftly</b> than it would were it in user space.	happening or done quickly and immediately 快速的，迅速的  这里是副词，意思是“快速地”
A major advantage of exokernel-based systems is that they can <b>incorporate</b> multiple library operating systems, each exporting a different API (application programming interface), such as one for Linux and one for Microsoft Windows, thus making it possible to simultaneously run both Linux and Windows applications.	to include sth so that it forms a part of sth 将...包括在内，吸收，使并入
<b>Proponents</b> of microkernels point out that monolithic kernels have the disadvantage that an error in the kernel can cause the entire system to crash.	支持者
This ability to <b>miniaturize</b> its kernel has also led to a rapid growth in the use of Linux in embedded systems (i.e., computer circuitry built into other products).	to make a much smaller version of sth  使微型化
Although microkernels are very small by themselves, in combination with all their required <b>auxiliary</b> code they are, in fact, often larger than monolithic kernels.	giving help or support  辅助的
Advocates of monolithic kernels also point out that the two-<b>tiered</b> structure of microkernel systems, in which most of the operating system does not interact directly with the hardware, creates a not-insignificant cost in terms of system efficiency.
