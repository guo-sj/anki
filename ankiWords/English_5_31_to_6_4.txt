The Jargon File contains <b>a bunch of</b> definitions of the term ‘hacker’, most having to do with technical adeptness and a delight in solving problems and overcoming limits.	a number of things of the same type which are growing or fastened together (一束，一把)	LongTermLearing
The hacker <b>mind-set<sub>[1]</sub></b> is not <b>confined to<sub>[2]</sub></b> this software-hacker culture.	[1]  a set of attitudes or fixed ideas that sb has ad that are often difficult to change      [2]  <i>be confined to ... </i>:  to have to stay ...(使离不开......)	LongTermLearing
Software hackers recognize these <b>kindred<sub>[1]</sub></b> spirits elsewhere and may call them ‘hackers’ too — and some claim that the hacker nature is really independent of the particular <b>medium<sub>[2]</sub></b> the hacker works in.

Hackers solve problems and build things, and they believe in freedom and voluntary <b>mutual</b> help. 	相互的	LongTermLearing
But if you think of <b>cultivating</b> hacker attitudes as just a way to gain acceptance in the culture, you'll miss the point. 	to develop an attitude, a way of talking or behaving, etc.(逐渐形成 某种态度，谈话或举止方式等)	LongTermLearing
Similarly, to be a hacker you have to get a basic <b>thrill</b> from solving problems, sharpening your skills, and exercising your intelligence.	a strong feeling of excitement or pleasure; (兴奋，快乐)	LongTermLearing
Otherwise you'll find your hacking energy is <b>sapped</b> by distractions like sex, money, and social approval.	to make sb/sth weaker(使虚弱)	LongTermLearing
To behave like a hacker, you have to believe that the thinking time of other hackers is precious — so much so that it's almost a moral duty for you to share information, solve problems and then give the solutions away just so other hackers can solve new problems instead of having to <b>perpetually</b> re-address old ones.	continuing for a long period of time without interruption.

Anyone who can give you orders can stop you from solving whatever problem you're being fascinated by — and, given the way authoritarian minds work, will generally find some <b>appallingly</b> stupid reason to do so. 	shocking; extremely bad; (令人震惊的)	LongTermLearing
So the authoritarian attitude has to be fought wherever you find it, <b>lest<sub>[1]</sub></b> it <b>smother</b> you and other hackers.	[1]  in order to prevent sth from happening (以免，免得)      [2]   to prevent sth from developing or being expressed(抑制，扼杀)	LongTermLearing
But that's a limited, <b>conscious</b> bargain; the kind of personal surrender authoritarians want is not on offer.	able to use your senses and mental powers to understand what is happening(有意识的)	LongTermLearing
Authoritarians <b>thrive on<sub>[1]</sub></b> <b>censorship<sub>[2]</sub></b> and secrecy. And they distrust voluntary cooperation and information-sharing — they only like ‘cooperation’ that they control. 	[1]  thrive on: to enjoy sth or be successful of sth(以干某事为乐)，而thrive本身则有“繁荣”之意。      [2]  the act or policy of censor books (书籍的审查)	LongTermLearing
So to behave like a hacker, you have to develop an instinctive hostility to censorship, secrecy, and the use of force or <b>deception<sub>[1]</sub></b> to <b>compel<sub>[2]</sub></b> responsible adults.	[1]  the act of deliberately making sb believe sth that is not true (欺骗)      [2]  to force sb to do sth;(强迫)	LongTermLearing
Hackers won't let posers waste their time, but they <b>worship</b> competence — especially competence at hacking, but competence at anything is valued. 	a strong feeling of love and respect for sb/sth(崇拜，崇敬)	LongTermLearing
Competence at demanding skills that few can master is especially good, and competence at demanding skills that involve mental <b>acuteness</b>, craft, and concentration is best.	acute: intelligence and quick to notice and understand things(敏锐的)，这里是名词，意为“敏锐”	LongTermLearing
If you <b>revere<sub>[1]</sub></b> competence, you'll enjoy developing it in yourself — the hard work and dedication will become a kind of <b>intense<sub>[2]</sub></b> play rather than drudgery.

Under Mac OS X it's possible, but only part of the system is open source — you're likely to hit a lot of walls, and you have to be careful not to develop the bad habit of depending on Apple's <b>proprietary</b> code. 	专利的	LongTermLearing
For this reason, the hacker culture today is pretty strongly Unix-centered. (This wasn't always true, and some old-time hackers still aren't happy about it, but the <b>symbiosis<sub>[1]</sub></b> between Unix and the Internet has become strong enough that even Microsoft's muscle doesn't seem able to seriously <b>dent<sub>[2]</sub></b> it.)

Back around 1991 I learned that many hackers who have English as a second language use it in technical discussions even <b>when they share a birth tongue</b>.	早在1991年左右，我就了解到，许多以英语为第二语言的黑客甚至在技术讨论中使用英语，即使他们共享出生语言;  这句话的意思是，当这些非英语为母语的黑客讨论技术问题的时候，也是用英语讨论，即使是他们有着共同的母语。	LongTermLearing

Accordingly, when you play the hacker game, you learn to keep score <b>primarily</b> by what other hackers think of your skill (this is why you aren't really a hacker until other hackers consistently call you one).	mainly. 主要地，基本地。 这句话的意思是：因此，当你玩黑客游戏时，你学会主要通过其他黑客对你的技术的看法来保持分数（这就是为什么你不是真的黑客，直到其他黑客持续的称你为“黑客”）。	LongTermLearing
This fact is <b>obscured<sub>[1]</sub></b> by the image of hacking as <b>solitary<sub>[2]</sub></b> work;	[1]  to make it difficult to see, hear or understand sth(掩盖)      [2]  done alone; without other people(独自的) 这里的意思是：这一事实被黑客作为单独工作的形象所掩盖	LongTermLearing

Finally, you can serve and <b>propagate</b> the culture itself (by, for example, writing an accurate primer on how to become a hacker :-)).	传播，宣传	LongTermLearing

When you've been in the <b>trenches</b> long enough, you may grow into one of these. 	a long deep hole dug in the ground, for example for carrying away water (沟，渠)	LongTermLearing
Beware: hackers distrust <b>blatant</b> ego in their tribal elders, so visibly reaching for this kind of fame is dangerous. 	明目张胆的  这里的意思是：小心： 黑客不信任他们的部落长老公然的自我， 所以明显达到这种名声是危险的。	LongTermLearing

For this reason, many hackers have adopted the label ‘geek’ as a badge of pride — it's a way of declaring their independence from normal social expectations (as well as a <b>fondness</b> for other things like science fiction and strategy games that often go with being a hacker). 	喜爱	LongTermLearing
