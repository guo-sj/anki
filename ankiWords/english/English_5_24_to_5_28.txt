The words <i>command</i> and <i>cmdlet</i> are often used <b>interchangeably</b> because a cmdlet is a type of command.	that can be exchanged, especially without affecting the way in which sth works(可交换的，可替换的)	LongTermLearing
This extension lets you run commands and also helps you with <b>snippets</b>, code completion, and syntax highlighting.	a small piece of information or news(一小条消息)	LongTermLearing

Although the program interrelationships are never made explicit in the manual, they form the <b>fabric</b> of the UNIX programming environment.	the basic structure of a society, an organization, etc. that enables it to function successful(结构)	LongTermLearing
<i>The Bell System Technical Journal (BSTJ)</i> special issue on the UNIX system (July, 1978) contains many papers describing <b>subsequent<sub>[1]</sub></b> developments, and some <b>retrospective<sub>[2]</sub></b> material, including an update of the original CACM paper by Ritchie and Thompson.

<i>A UNIX <b>Primer</b></i>, by Ann and Nico Lomuto (Prentice-Hall, 1983), is a good introduction for raw beginners, especially non-programmers.	a book that contains basic instruction(入门书)	LongTermLearing
That is less of an oversimplification than you might think.	这可不像你想象的那么简单。	LongTermLearing
No structure is imposed on a file by the system, and no meaning is attached to its contents -- the meaning of the bytes depends <b>solely</b> on the programs that interpret the file.	only(只，仅仅)	LongTermLearing
Furthermore, as we shall see, this is true not just of disc files but of <b>peripheral</b> devices as well.	外围的	LongTermLearing
Magnetic tapes, mail messages, characters typed on the keyboard, line printer output, data flowing in pipes -- each of these files is just a sequence of bytes <b> as far as </b> the system and the programs in it <b> are concerned.</b>.	就... 而言。 这里的意思是：就系统和其中的程序而言，每个文件就像是一串字符序列。	LongTermLearing
The 7-digit numbers down the left side are positions in the file, that is, the <b>ordinal</b> number of the next character shown, in octal.	序数词，如 first, second, etc.	LongTermLearing
By the way, the emphasis on octal numbers is a <b>holdover</b> from the PDP-11, for which octal was the preferred notation.	遗留下的东西。这里的意思是：8进制数是从PDP-11那里留存下来的东西。	LongTermLearing
If you type '\\', however, the kernel interprets that to mean that you want a literal backspace in the input, so the '\' is discarded and the byte '010' <b>winds up</b> in your file.	以...的样子结束。 这里的意思是：如果你输入'\\'，那么内核就会把它解释成八进制数'010'	LongTermLearing
Rather than using a special code, the system <b>signifies</b> the end of a file by simply saying there is no more data in the file	to be a sign of sth (预示，表示)	LongTermLearing
One reason is to avoid <b>foreclosing</b> some useful computation.	to reject sth as a possibility.(排除...的可能性)	LongTermLearing
And it would certainly make it harder for us to <b>typeset</b> the C programs in chapter 6~8.	排版	LongTermLearing

The <b>transcripts</b> you see on almost every page are made by commands like: <i>od -c junk >temp   ed ch2.1 ...</i>, 'od' produces text on its standard output, which can be used anywhere text can be used.	a written or printed copy of words that has been spoken(打印本，手抄本)	LongTermLearing
This <b>uniformity</b> is unusual; most systems have several file formats, even for text, and require negotiation by a program or a user to create a file of a particular type.	统一性	LongTermLearing
Whenever you <b>embark</b> on a new project, or whenever you have a set of related files, say a set of recipes, you could create a new directory with <i>mkdir</i> and put the files there.	to get onto a ship; to put sth onto a ship(上船，装船)	LongTermLearing
For example, the <b>crust</b> recipe could be kept in <i>recipes/pie/crust</i> rather than duplicating it in each pie recipe.	馅饼的酥皮	LongTermLearing
The obvious solution is a command or two to <b>rummage</b> around in directories.	to move things carefully while searching for sth (翻阅，翻查)	LongTermLearing
But they(directories) can't be created or written as ordinary files -- to preserve its <b>sanity</b> and the users' files, the kernel reserves to itself all control over the contents of directories.	the state of being sensible and reasonable(明智，理智)	LongTermLearing
You could therefore change the permissions on each letter to <b>frustrate gossip<sub>[1]</sub></b> (or only on some of the letters, to encourage it), or you might just change the permissions on the directories containing the letters, and <b>thwart snoopers<sub>[2]</sub></b> that way.

The former requires <b>malfeasance</b> and the latter takes hard work, however, <i>crypt</i> is in practice fairly secure.	渎职（滥用职权， 玩忽职守）	LongTermLearing
