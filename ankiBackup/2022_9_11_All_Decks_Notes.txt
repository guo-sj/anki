Great <b>fleas</b> have little fleas	跳蚤	LongTermLearning
While these again have greater <b>still</b>, and greater still, and so on.	更加	LongTermLearning
wc will count more than one file for you (and print the totals), and it will also <b>suppress</b> any of the counts if requested.	to prevent sth from being published or made down(禁止发表，查禁)	LongTermLearning
"<i>grep -v</i>  It's named '-v', you can think of it as <b>inverting</b> the sense of the match."	<b>invert</b>:&nbsp; 颠倒	LongTermLearning
"<i>grep</i> will also handle much more complicated patterns than just words like ""fleas"", but we will defer <b>consideration</b> of that until Chapter 4."	考虑（名词）	LongTermLearning
<i>sort</i> has <b>zillions</b> of options to control the order of sorting.	a very large number(非常多)	LongTermLearning
"That's <b>overkill</b> for our eight-line poem, but it's good for larger files."	too much of sth that reduces the effect it has(过犹不及)	LongTermLearning
an <b>inversion</b> of the truth	the act of changing the position or order of sth to its opposite, or of turning sth upside down 倒置	LongTermLearning
This is where file comparison commands <b>come in handy</b>.	派上用场	LongTermLearning
Greater directories have <b>lesser</b> directories.	not as great in size, amount or importance as sb/sth else(较小的)	LongTermLearning
<b>Conversely</b>	反过来	LongTermLearning
Even if your home directory is not <i>/usr/you</i>, <i>pwd</i> will print something <b>analogous</b>, so you should be able to follow what happens below.	similar in some way to another thing or situation and therefore able to be compared with it(相似的)	LongTermLearning
Pathname has an <b>intuitive</b> meaning: it represents the full name of the path from the root through the tree of directories to a particular file.	easy to understand and to use(易懂的，使用简便的)	LongTermLearning
"If Mary doesn't want you <b>poking around</b> in her files, or vice versa, privacy can be arranged."	to look for sth, especially sth that hidden among oother things that you have to move(搜查，翻找)	LongTermLearning
"There is nothing special about commands like 'cat' and 'ls', except that they have been collected into a couple of directories to be easy to find and <b>administer.</b>"	to manage and organize the affairs of a company, an organizition, etc(管理)	LongTermLearning
"When the system prints the prompt $ and you type commands that get executed, it's not the kernel that is talking to you, but a <b>go-between</b> called the command interpreter or <i>shell</i>."	中间人	LongTermLearning
The <i>shell</i> is just an ordinary program like <i>date</i> or <i>who</i>, although it can do some <b>remarkable</b> things.	unusual or surprising in a way that causes people to take notice(引人注目的)	LongTermLearning
Physically it should be divided too, because it is <b>cumbersome</b> to edit large files.	long or complicated(单词或短语 冗长的，复杂的)	LongTermLearning
In the next section, we will see how this principle is <b>exploited</b>.	to use sth well in order to gain as much from it as possible(利用，运用)	LongTermLearning
"This is where the convention of reading the standard input when no files are named <b>pays off</b>: any program that adheres to<font size=""2"" style=""font-weight: bold;"">&nbsp;</font>the convention can be used in pipelines.<br>"	(of a plan or an action, especially one that involves risk)to be successful and bring good result(奏效，成功) 	LongTermLearning
This means that the programs in a pipeline can be <b>interactive</b>; the kernel looks after whatever scheduling and synchronization is needed to make it all work.	that allows information to be passed continuously and in both directions between a computer and person who uses it(交互式的)	LongTermLearning
As you probably suspect by now, the shell arranges things when you ask for a pipe; the individual programs are <b>oblivious</b> to the redirection.	not aware of sth(未察觉，不知道)	LongTermLearning
Finally, you can simply tell the system to start your process at some <b>wee</b> hour of the morning when normal people are asleep, not computing.	small in amount(少量的)	LongTermLearning
One of the <b>virtues</b> of the UNIX system is that there are several ways to bring it closer to your personal taste or the conventions of your local computing environment.	an attractive or useful quality(优点)	LongTermLearning

In many systems, especially government systems, everything must be traced and evaluated, or <b>audited</b>.	an official examination of business and financial records to see that they are true and correct(审计，审查)	LongTermLearning
The words <i>command</i> and <i>cmdlet</i> are often used <b>interchangeably</b> because a cmdlet is a type of command.	that can be exchanged, especially without affecting the way in which sth works(可交换的，可替换的)	LongTermLearning
This extension lets you run commands and also helps you with <b>snippets</b>, code completion, and syntax highlighting.	a small piece of information or news(一小条消息)	LongTermLearning
Use for any other reason is <b>prohibited</b>, and may result in permanent loss of access to the sandbox.	to stop sth from being done or used especially by law(尤指以法令方式禁止)	LongTermLearning
Three core cmdlets allow you to <b>delve into</b> what cmdlets exist and what they do.	to try hard to find out more information about sth (探索，探究)	LongTermLearning
Or use an alias <i>help</i> command to invoke Get-Help but improve the reading experience by <b>paginating</b> the response.	to give a number to each page of a book. (给书标注页码)	LongTermLearning
Use the Get-Member core cmdlet to <b>drill down</b> into that response and learn more about it.	to go to deeper levels of an organized set of data in order to find more detail, especially on a computer or a website (自顶向下搜索)	LongTermLearning

Although the program interrelationships are never made explicit in the manual, they form the <b>fabric</b> of the UNIX programming environment.	the basic structure of a society, an organization, etc. that enables it to function successful(结构，架构)	LongTermLearning
<i>The Bell System Technical Journal (BSTJ)</i> special issue on the UNIX system (July, 1978) contains many papers describing subsequent&nbsp;developments, and some <b>retrospective</b>&nbsp;material, including an update of the original CACM paper by Ritchie and Thompson.	<div>thinking about or connected with sth that happened in the past (回顾的，涉及以往的)</div>	LongTermLearning
"The <i>UNIX Programmer's Manual</i>, in whatever version is appropriate for your system, lists commands, system routines and interfaces, file formats, and <b>maintenance</b> procedures."	the act of making a state or situation continue(维持，保持)	LongTermLearning
<i>A UNIX <b>Primer</b></i>, by Ann and Nico Lomuto (Prentice-Hall, 1983), is a good introduction for raw beginners, especially non-programmers.	a book that contains basic instruction(入门书)	LongTermLearning
<b>That is less of an oversimplification than you might think.</b>	这可不像你想象的那么简单。	LongTermLearning
No structure is imposed on a file by the system, and no meaning is attached to its contents -- the meaning of the bytes depends <b>solely</b> on the programs that interpret the file.	only(只，仅仅)	LongTermLearning
Furthermore, as we shall see, this is true not just of disc files but of <b>peripheral</b> devices as well.	外围的	LongTermLearning
Magnetic tapes, mail messages, characters typed on the keyboard, line printer output, data flowing in pipes -- each of these files is just a sequence of bytes <b> as far as </b> the system and the programs in it <b> are concerned</b>.	就... 而言。 这里的意思是：就系统和其中的程序而言，每个文件就像是一串字符序列。	LongTermLearning
The 7-digit numbers down the left side are positions in the file, that is, the <b>ordinal</b> number of the next character shown, in octal.	序数词，如 first, second, etc.	LongTermLearning
By the way, the emphasis on octal numbers is a <b>holdover</b> from the PDP-11, for which octal was the preferred notation.	遗留下的东西。这里的意思是：8进制数是从PDP-11那里留存下来的东西。	LongTermLearning
"If you type '\\', however, the kernel interprets that to mean that you want a literal backspace in the input, so the '\' is discarded and the byte '010' <b>winds up</b> in your file."	"以...的样子结束。 这里的意思是：如果你输入'\\'，那么内核就会把它解释成八进制数'010'"	LongTermLearning
Rather than using a special code, the system <b>signifies</b> the end of a file by simply saying there is no more data in the file.	to be a sign of sth (预示，表示)	LongTermLearning
One reason is to avoid <b>foreclosing</b> some useful computation.	foreclose:&nbsp; to reject sth as a possibility.(排除...的可能性)	LongTermLearning
And it would certainly make it harder for us to <b>typeset</b> the C programs in chapter 6~8.	排版	LongTermLearning
Instead of creating distinctions, the UNIX system tries to <b>efface</b> them.	to make sth disappear(消除)	LongTermLearning
"The <b>transcripts</b> you see on almost every page are made by commands like:&nbsp;<div><i>od -c junk &gt;temp&nbsp;</i></div><div><i>&nbsp;ed ch2.1 ...</i></div><div>'od' produces text on its standard output, which can be used anywhere text can be used.</div>"	a written or printed copy of words that has been spoken(打印本，手抄本)	LongTermLearning
This <b>uniformity</b> is unusual; most systems have several file formats, even for text, and require negotiation by a program or a user to create a file of a particular type.	统一性	LongTermLearning
Whenever you <b>embark</b> on a new project, or whenever you have a set of related files, say a set of recipes, you could create a new directory with <i>mkdir</i> and put the files there.	to get onto a ship; to put sth onto a ship(上船，装船)&nbsp; 这里应该是“<b>装载</b>”的意思	LongTermLearning
For example, the <b>crust</b> recipe could be kept in <i>recipes/pie/crust</i> rather than duplicating it in each pie recipe.	馅饼的酥皮	LongTermLearning
The obvious solution is a command or two to <b>rummage</b> around in directories.	to move things carefully while searching for sth (翻阅，翻查)	LongTermLearning
"But they(directories) can't be created or written as ordinary files -- to preserve its <b>sanity</b> and the users' files, the kernel reserves to itself all control over the contents of directories."	the state of being sensible and reasonable(明智，理智) ，这里应该被理解为：合理性	LongTermLearning
"You could therefore change the permissions on each letter to frustrate gossip<span style=""font-weight: bold; font-size: 16.6667px;"">&nbsp;</span>(or only on some of the letters, to encourage it), or you might just change the permissions on the directories containing the letters, and <b>thwart snoopers</b>&nbsp;that way."	<div>阻止窥探者</div>	LongTermLearning
The former requires <b>malfeasance</b> and the latter takes hard work, however, <i>crypt</i> is in practice fairly secure.	渎职（滥用职权， 玩忽职守）	LongTermLearning
